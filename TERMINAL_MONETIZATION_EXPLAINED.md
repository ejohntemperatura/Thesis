# Terminal Leave & Monetization - What They Are

## 🎯 Important Understanding

**Terminal Leave and Monetization are NOT regular leave types!**

They are **leave credit conversions** - converting your accumulated leave credits into cash payment.

## 📋 What's the Difference?

### Regular Leave (Vacation, Sick, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Take time off from work
- **Calendar**: You select specific dates you'll be absent
- **Impact**: Marked as absent in DTR/attendance
- **Late Application**: Yes, if dates are in the past
- **Example**: "I want to take vacation from Dec 10-15"

### Terminal Leave / Monetization
- **Purpose**: Convert leave credits to cash
- **Calendar**: No calendar needed - not taking time off
- **Impact**: No absence, no DTR impact - you still work
- **Late Application**: No - not date-based
- **Example**: "I want to convert 10 days of leave credits to cash"

## 🎓 Summary

Think of it this way:
- **Regular Leave** = "I want time off" → Select calendar dates
- **Terminal/Monetization** = "I want to cash out my credits" → Enter number of credits

You're not requesting time off - you're requesting to convert your accumulated leave credits into cash payment!
